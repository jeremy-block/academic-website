### Hi, I'm Jeremy ðŸ‘‹
I am a Ph.D. Student at the University of Florida, where I study Human-Centered Computing and Data Visualization. I work on understanding how people make sense of data through analysis, aka the sensemaking process. I have examined how human's calibrate their trust in AI tools, how past work representation may influence future task performance, and demonstrated how large language models may be helpful for supporting custom work reports. Today, I am completing my dissertation to better understand the impacts of automatic work summaries for hand-off analysis tasks.
